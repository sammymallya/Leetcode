# LeetCode Solutions

Welcome to my LeetCode solutions repository! Here, I have organized my solutions based on data structures and difficulty levels to make navigation easier.

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure
Each problem is stored inside a folder corresponding to the data structure or algorithm it primarily focuses on. Additionally, problems are also categorized by difficulty level.
